# August 10th: Made the pcb.

Firstly I researched what exectly I wanted to make. I found out I wanted to make a passive mixer. So that I didn't have to deal with power or amplification. Because this is my first pcb. Then I asked some specific questions to chat GPT. From this I figured out that I needed dual-gang potentiometers and 10K ohm mixing resistors. Then I started on the parts list. Searching through lcsc for the parts I wanted. I gave up on also connecting the mic, because I could'n find a 3.5mm audio jack that also detects when nothing is pluged in. So then I made the schematic. It's actually pretty simple. I just had to follow what chat GPT told me. Finally I made the pcb itself. I found out that almost every wire could be on the top side of the board. So I chose to make the bottem a ground plane. I also added to the top silkscreen, some symbols and text. That way it's clear what side is for the speaker, and what side is for the headset.
