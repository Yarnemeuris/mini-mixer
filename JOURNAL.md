# August 9th: Made the pcb.

Firstly I researched what exectly I wanted to make. I found out I wanted to make a passive mixer. So that I didn't have to deal with power or amplification. Because this is my first pcb. Then I asked some specific questions to chat GPT. From this I figured out that I needed dual-gang potentiometers and 10K ohm mixing resistors. Then I started on the parts list. Searching through lcsc for the parts I wanted. I gave up on also connecting the mic, because I could'n find a 3.5mm audio jack that also detects when nothing is pluged in. So then I made the schematic. It's actually pretty simple. I just had to follow what chat GPT told me. Finally I made the pcb itself. I found out that almost every wire could be on the top side of the board. So I chose to make the bottem a ground plane. I also added to the top silkscreen, some symbols and text. That way it's clear what side is for the speaker, and what side is for the headset.
That was it for today. Tomorow I will export all the files, and maybe ask some people to review the pcb.

# August 10th: Finished the pcb.

I decided that won't review the board, because it's pretty simple and should work. I also tried ordering the pcb from jlcpcb. But I saw that they didn't have the specific potentiometers in stock. But they are available on lcsc. So I asked on the slack if I can order the pcb and part seperetly, and assemble it myself. Because almost all the components are through hole anyways, and it's not hard to change the resistors to through hole aswell.

But the answers said that I could beter do pcba. Because I'm going for the pcba grant, and you can't do a tutorial board on the hardware grant. Also I'm not very good at soldering. So I wwent back to lcsc in search of another potentiometer i could use. I found another one that jlcpcb has in stock, and switched out the potentiometers.

So I went through all the steps of ordering with pcba.

Then I made my repository ready to submit my project. Saw while adding to the journal that I out august 10th on the first day. While I started the day before that. I think I wrote the 10th because I made the journal past 12 AM. So I saw that the day was the 10th, even though the day I talked about was the 9th.
That was it for today. After commiting this I will submit the project. Then it should be done.
