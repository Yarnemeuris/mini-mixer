It uses 10K ohm dual-gang potentiometers, with 10K ohm mixing resistors. Has 3 volume adjustable inputs, and 2 outputs. If nothing is plugged into the headphone output, it will automaticly switch to the speaker output.

The pcb has 2 mounting holes for a case that I will design once I have the board. It also clearly states what is the speaker and headphone output via the silkscreen.
